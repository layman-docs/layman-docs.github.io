## Welcome to Layman docs

We are a community of knowledge seekers united on the goal of sharing it.

Together from many areas, from the complete occasional hobbyist to
professionals.

We are united to create introductions to several topics, and even delve into
creating some original content. We have a couple scientists laying around.

From opinions to scientific fact, we prove everything we state, or at least
we justify it. That's the law.

For what is a fact?

### Why did you choose to waste time doing this?

We aren't wasting time, from a certain point of view.

Writing about things, help us to clarify our sense of things too.

We are all noobs at something.

If we were curious about it, people might have advice and all,
but nothing like a good doc on the steps to understand it.

Besides, people tend to be very vague about it all.

Ask a programmer, which is my case, "How can I learn how to program?".
My typical answer is basically:
- Learn to understand computers as machines
- Grab "The C Programming Language"
- Be patient, and start running, because it is a long way to go

Other areas, for example, if one was curious about Philosophy?
I'd probably tell them to expect the worst, because asking about such a broad
topic tends to be an endless pit of dedication.

Yet, I'd say to start with Plato or something.

Get it? So we are gathering people from many areas, to write about topics such
that you can learn from zero to pseudo-hero in a structured form.

Introductions, to proper content.

### How to participate?

Just mail one of our members and talk to them. You could mail me, if you wish.
