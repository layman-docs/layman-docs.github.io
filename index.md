## Welcome to Layman docs

We are a community of knowledge seekers united on the goal of sharing it.
Together from many areas, from the complete occasional hobbyist to
professionals, we are united to create introductions to several topics, and
even delve into creating some original content, such as theories and new tech.

From opinions to Scientific fact, we prove everything we state, or at least
we justify it. For what is a fact?

### Why did you choose to waste time doing this?

We aren't wasting time, from a certain point of view. We are all noobs at
something. If we were curious about it, people might have advices and all,
but nothing like a good doc on the steps to understand it.
Besides, people tend to be very vague about it all.

Ask a programmer, which is my case, "How can I learn how to program?".
My typical answer is learn about computers, grab "The C Programming Language",
and start running.

Other areas, for example, if one was curious about Philosophy?
I'd probably tell them to expect the worse, because asking about such a broad
topic tends to be an endless pit of dedication. Yet, I'd say to start with
Plato or something.

Get it? So we are gathering people from many areas, to write about topics such
that you can learn from zero to pseudo-hero in a structured form.

Introductions, to proper content.
